# Keycloak 2FA SMS Authenticator

Keycloak Authentication Provider implementation to get a 2nd-factor authentication with a OTP/code/token send via SMS with a configurable HTTPS API.
It should be possible to interact with most SMS providers. Issues and pull requests to support more SMS providers are welcome.

This is a fork of a great demo implementation by [@dasniko](https://github.com/dasniko/keycloak-2fa-sms-authenticator), and also takes huge chunks of code
from the original authenticator provider [documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/index.html#_auth_spi) and [example](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/main/examples/providers/authenticator) from Keycloak itself.

# Installing
1. Go to https://github.com/netzbegruenung/keycloak-mfa-plugins/releases and download
   the latest .jar file.
1. Copy the created jar file into the `providers` directory of your Keycloak:
   ```shell
   cp netzbegruenung.keycloak-2fa-sms-authenticator.jar /path/to/keycloak/providers
   ```
1. Run the `build` command and restart Keycloak:
   ```shell
   /path/to/keycloak/bin/kc.sh build [your-additional-flags]
   systemctl restart keycloak.service
   ```

# Setup
1. Navigate to your Authentication flow configuration: https://keycloak.example.com/admin/master/console/#/YOUR-REALM/authentication. Then edit the `Browser flow`.
1. Add a new step next to the `OTP Form` step. Choose the `SMS Authentication (2FA)` authenticator and set it to `Alternative`.
1. Make sure that you name it `sms-2fa`. This is currently a hack that will hopefully be fixed. Additional executions with other names can be added. But this first execution will be used for the confirmation SMS when setting up a new phone number.
1. Go into the config of the execution and configure the plugin so that it works with the API of your SMS proivder HTTP API. The data is always sent in a HTTP POST request. Refer to the API documentation of your provider to choose the correct configuration values. The details of the request can be configured with the following configuration options:
   1. `SMS API URL`: the URL to which the HTTP POST request should be sent.
   1. `URL encode data`: When off, the data will be sent as an `application/json` body. When on, the data will be encoded as URL parameters.
   1. `Put API Secret Token in Authorization Header`: If set, API Secret will be sent as Authorization Header, 'API Secret Token Attribute' and 'Basic Auth Username' will be ignored.
   1. `API Secret Token Attribute (optional)`: Name of attribute that contains your API token/secret. In some APIs the secret is already configured in the path. In this case, this can be left empty.
   1. `API Secret (optional)`: Your API secret. If a Basic Auth user is set, this will be the Basic Auth password. If `API Secret Token Attribute` is set, this secret will be sent as the value to the given attribute name.
   1. `Basic Auth Username (optional)`: If set, Basic Auth will be performed. Leave empty if not required.
   1. `Message Attribute`: The attribute that contains the SMS message text. For many APIs (i.e. GTX Messaging, SMS Eagle) this is `text`.
   1. `Receiver Phone Number Attribute`: The attribute that contains the receiver phone number. For many APIs (i.e. GTX Messaging, SMS Eagle) this is `to`.
   1. `Sender Phone Number Attribute`: The attribute that contains the sender phone number. Leave empty if not required.
   1. `SenderId`: The sender ID is displayed as the message sender on the receiving device. This is the value for the `Sender Phone Number Attribute`.
   1. `Use message UUID`: If your API requires UUID for a message, you can generate it with this property.
   2. `UUID attribute`: The attribute that contains the generated UUID. Only aplicable when `Use message UUID` is set.
   3. `Request JSON template`: If default JSON template is not enough for your needs, put your custom template here. UUID (if 'Use message UUID' is set), phone number and message (in that order) use placeholders `%s`.
1. Go to `/admin/master/console/#/realm/authentication/required-actions` and enable required actions "Phone Validation" and "Update Mobile Number"

# Usage
After successfully configured the authenticator and the required actions users can set up SMS Authentication in the
account console `/realms/realm/account/#/account-security/signing-in` by entering and confirming their phone number.

# Enforce SMS 2FA
If the option `Force 2FA` in the SMS Authenticator config is enabled and a user has no other 2FA method already enabled,
users will have to set up the SMS Authenticator.
